Code and hardware developed by our lab is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/RoboticExplorationLab). We also host and actively contribute to several other open-source projects, including the [PyCubed](https://pycubed.org) satellite avionics platform. 

This website is based on code from the [SAMPA group at the University of Washington](https://github.com/uwsampa/research-group-web).
