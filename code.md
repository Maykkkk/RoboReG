|**Chase and Run**<br/>[[gym-adversarial-cars](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-IIT-BHU/gym-adversarial-cars)] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|Adversarial Chase and Run Cars Gym is a gym environment, to test and develop algorithms related to Multi Agent Systems, especially those related to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. This was done under the Robotics Research Group (RoboReG) to try and learn emergent behavior between agents competing against each other via Reinforcement learning and how it could generate new control strategies.|

|**Simultaneous Multitasking Agent**<br/>[[gym-Baxter_SMA](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-IIT-BHU/gym-Baxter_SMA)]| This environment is made by our team from RoboReG of Robotics Club,IIT BHU to tackle an open challenge in the field of robotics, which is Simultaneous work. Generally, Humans have a good efficiency in managing different things simultaneously using both hands. Hence, we want to explore how the Reinforcement Learning Algorithms are trying to achieve this task comparable to humans or even better. For this purpose Baxter humanoid robot is used as the Agent. It is a gym compatible environment made using simulator PyBullet|

|**Modular Robotics With Swarm Intelligence**<br/>[[gym-iOTA](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-IIT-BHU/gym-iOTA)]|This is an Open-AI gym environment developed with a modular bot platform named 'iOTA'. The motive of this gym is to allow us to test out and develop Algorithms for such a MultiAgent System. This is further used to learn heirarchial planning of such a MultiAgent systems to develop a generalized swarm behaviour in the robots (i.e., Colabortively working towards achieving a objective). |

| **Vision 2.0**<br/>[[arena](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-IIT-BHU/Vision-2.0-2020-Arena)] | Vision 2.0 is an Image-Processing based Robotics Competition being organized by the *Robotics Club, IIT (BHU), Varanasi* to facilitate learning about different components of image processing and its application in building robots capable of autonomous movement. In this online semester, as all of us are not present physically in the campus conducting a physical robotics competition was not feasible. Hence, this year the event will be held online using Pybullet, a Bullet Physics Simulator. |
| <br/> | <br/> |
| [**Summer-camp 2020**](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-IIT-BHU/Robo-Summer-Camp-20) | The current edition of the summer camp conducted by the *Robotics Club, IIT (BHU)-2020*, aims at providing a structured approach towards robot development and control based on the simulation tool PyBullet. This repository will be the primary source of code and content related to the camp.The repository will be updated part-wise with subfolders which has the topic wise theory and problem statements/tasks. |
