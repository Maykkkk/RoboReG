## Introduction:

The challenges involved in cleaning and maintaining Pipes System in various industries that actually require high human workload, health risk and much time consuming. Hence there is much need for such autonomous robot, which can be deployed in various piplines, to ensure robustness and travel to the pipe where it is difficult for a human to reach.

Hence, our work is aimed to train the robot to look for the defect and sanitising pipelines which saves money, time and labor effort.
